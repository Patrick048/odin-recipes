    <h4>This amazing salted caramel sauce has become my ultimate warm ice cream topping.</h4>

    <p>It's easy to make with sugar, butter, cream, and a pinch of sea salt.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1 cup white sugar</li>
      <li>5 tablespoons unsalted butter, cut into slices</li>
      <li>Â½ cup heavy cream</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon heavy cream</li>
      <li>1 pinch sea salt, or to taste</li>
    </ul>

    <ol>
      <li>Place sugar in a heavy-bottomed saucepan set over medium-high heat,
        <p>stirring continuously until sugar begins to melt. Continue stirring until
        <p>sugar melts completely, begins to darken, and all chunks are dissolved,
        <p>about 10 minutes. Stop stirring; continue to cook until sugar begins to
        <p>smoke and turns a dark shade of amber, 3 to 8 minutes. Remove from
        <p>heat and wait 30 seconds.</p>
      </li>
      <li>Whisk in butter until melted and combined. Slowly pour in 1/2 cup plus
        <p>1 tablespoon cream, taking care because it can bubble over. Sprinkle in
        <p>salt; stir to combine. Transfer sauce to a jar; cool completely before  
        <p>refrigerating.</p>
      </li>
    </ol>
